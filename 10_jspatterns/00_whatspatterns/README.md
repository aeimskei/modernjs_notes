# What Are Patterns?

All programming language has design patterns. In this section we'll learn about some patterns in JavaScript.

* A **pattern** is a re-usable solution that can be applied to occuring problems in software design. In this case, we're talking about JavaScript Applications because that's the language we're focusing on here.

* You can also think of them as programming templates. Create a specific way for writing code. 

* The situation varies significantly. Some patterns like the **Factory** and **Prototype** patterns are used for Object creation. The **Module** pattern and all of its variations are used for overall structure. Then you have complete software design patterns like **MVC** the Model View Controller pattern. So it can be applied to a whole application or blocks of code.

We've already used some of the patterns like the **constructor** pattern and  the **prototype** pattern, but we'll get more into some of the specific **design patterns** that are offered in JavaScript.

* **(1) Module Pattern** - used for overall structure and allows us to break our code up into *modules* we can have private/public functions and variables. 

* **(2) Revealing Module Pattern** - used for overall structure and allows us to break our code up into *modules* we can have private/public functions and variables. We return an object literal that reveals the methods inside the module.

* **(3) Singleton Pattern** - variation of the Module Pattern, where we can only create one instance of an Object.

* **(4) Factory Pattern** - used to create many, many Objects.

* **(5) Observer Pattern** - allows us to subscribe and unsubscribe to events.

* **(6) Mediator Pattern** - has a central mediator and colleagues that separates off from it. 

* **(7) State Pattern** - allows us to have a certain state in our application and we can change that *state*
