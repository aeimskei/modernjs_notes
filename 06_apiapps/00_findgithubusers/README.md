# Find GitHub Users App

Where we can search GitHub users by their username, it'll fetch their profile and give us all their user information, a list of their respositories and links to them, showing us how many forks, watchers, etc.

## Covers

* ES6+
* Async Await, Fetch
* Create JS file responsible for reaching out to the API
* UI Class to handle inserting content to the DOM

## GitHub API

Easy to use, but can only make about 100 request per hour without and API Key (everytime we type something into our search bar, it's making a request), so we need to register the application with GitHub to get an API Key.
