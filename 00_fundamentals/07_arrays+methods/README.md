# Arrays and Array Methods

Arrays are important in many programming languages. they allow us to store multiple values in one variable, they can be mutated and iterated through, and they can be used in really complex algorithms.

* Look at creating arrays
* Mutating them with helpful methods avaiable in JS

# Create some arrays

There are a couple ways to define arrays.
* Using brackets ```[]``` is popular
* Use the Array constructor / Array object

```
const numbers = [43,56,33,23,44,36,5];
const numbers2 = new Array(22,45,33,76,54);
let val;                            // Initialize val to mutate later
console.log(numbers);               // Put below code
console.log(val);                   // Put below code
```

Arrays don't have to be just numbers, can be an array of strings.
```
const fruit = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange', 'Pear'];
```

Arrays can be a mix of different data types too.
```
const mixed = [2, 'Hello', true, undefined, null, {a:1, b:2}, new Date()];
console.log(mixed);       

// Logs [2, "Hello", true, undefined, null, {â€¦}, Thu Aug 23 2018 13:29:30 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)]
```

## Get Array length
Get how many values is in the array. Similar to how we used the length property with a string.
```
val = numbers.length;             // Logs 7 as a number
```

## Check if is Array with array object ```isArray()``` method
```
val = Array.isArray(numbers);     // Logs true
val = Array.isArray('hello');     // Logs false
```

This is useful when working in the DOM, for example, when returning a node list from the DOM, which is structured like an array, but it's not an actual array, so we can't do certain things like forEach loops. So, it's a good way to test if something is an array. Then, you can convert it into an array if you need to.

## Get a single value from an array

Put in the position or index of the value that you want

```
val = numbers[3];               // Logs 23 bc 3rd index in [43,56,33,23,44,36,5]
val = numbers[0];               // Logs 43
```
## Insert into array

What if we want to insert something into the array?
Arrays are not immutable, we can modify them.

```
numbers[2] = 100;               // Logs [43, 56, 100, 23, 44, 36, 5]
```

## ```indexOf()``` method to find index of a value
```
val = numbers.indexOf(36);      // Logs 5 bc 36 is in the 5th position
```

# Mutating Arrays with Different Methods

## ```push()``` method

Add on the end of the array
```
numbers.push(250);          // Logs [43, 56, 100, 23, 44, 36, 5, 250]
```

## ```unshift()``` method

Add on to the front of the array
```
numbers.unshift(120);       // Logs [120, 43, 56, 100, 23, 44, 36, 5, 250]
```

## ```pop()``` method

Take off from the end to the front
```
numbers.pop();              // Logs [120, 43, 56, 100, 23, 44, 36, 5]
```

## ```shift()``` method

Take off from the front
```
numbers.shift();            // Logs [43, 56, 100, 23, 44, 36, 5]
```

## ```splice()``` method

Splice out values from any point of the array.
Say, we want to take out 56. Defined first in position one and only one value.
Define where you want to start and end.
What if we want to take the two after 56 instead.
```
numbers.splice(1, 1);          // Logs [43, 100, 23, 44, 36, 5]
numbers.splice(1, 3);          // Logs [43, 44, 36, 5]
```

## ```reverse()``` method to reverse the array
```
numbers.reverse();             // Logs [5, 36, 44, 43]
```

## ```concat()``` method to concatenate arrays
```
val = numbers.concat(numbers2);   // Logs [5, 36, 44, 43, 22, 45, 33, 76, 54]
```

## ```sort()``` method

* The fruit variable is going to be sorted in alphabetical order.
* With numbers, it's going to sort by the first number.
```
val = fruit.sort();               // Logs ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Pear"]
val = numbers.sort();             // Logs [100, 23, 36, 43, 44, 5, 56]
```

Use the compare function to fix number sort
```
val = numbers.sort(function(a, b){    
  return a - b;
});

// Logs [5, 23, 36, 43, 44, 56, 100]
```

Reverse sort
```
val = numbers.sort(function(a, b){    
  return b - a;
});

// Logs [100, 56, 44, 43, 36, 23, 5]
```

## ```find()``` method

The find() method takes in a testing function.
```
function under50(num){
  return num < 50;
}

val = numbers.find(under50);          // Logs 43, the first number under50
```

Do the opposite
```
function over50(num){
  return num > 50;
}

val = numbers.find(over50);          // Logs 56, the first number over50
```
