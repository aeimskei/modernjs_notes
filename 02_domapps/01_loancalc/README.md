## Setup UI

Add Bootstrap ```.container``` class, this puts everything in the middle, it'll add some margin-auto for margins on the sides.

Use the ```grid systeme``` inside the ```.container``` by inserting a ```.row```

Inside the ```.row```, we want a ```6``` column ```<div>```, so use the class ```col-md-6``` and add a class of ```mx-auto```, which is gonna push it into the middle giving it margin auto on the right and left sides.

Inside that, add a ```.card``` class with a another class of ```.card-body``` and for everything to be centered, add the class of ```text-center``` and also a class of ```mt-5``` which is for margin-top.

Now, you'll see an empty card in the middle bc we have that mx-auto class:
