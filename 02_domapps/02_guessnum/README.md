# Guess Number Game

Good way to learn more about changing and keeping track of values, working with the DOM and structuring things in application.

The game, guess a number between a certain range and find the range within the application we'll create, like 1-10. The player will enter a guess number. Then when player submits, it'll tell the player whether their is correct or incorrect, and also tells the player how guess is left. If guesses run out, it'll say something like 'sorry' and the correct answer. Also, once the guesses are all used up, the player can't enter another number anymore. This inability to add number seems little, but it adds to the user experience and making it clear on what the user is supposed to do.
