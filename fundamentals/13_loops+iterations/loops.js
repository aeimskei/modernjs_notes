// ================================================

// For Loop
/*
Set up ```for() { }``` like a function, and it takes in three parameters separated by ```;``` semicolons. The first is going to be the declaration of a variable, you always want to use either ```var``` or ```let```, ```let i = 0``` ```i``` is used very commonly, but you can use anything.The second parameter is going to be the condition, ```i < 10```, as long as ```i``` is less than ```10```. The last parameter is going to be an increment of ```i``` as ```i++``` which bascially means ```i = i + 1```, so it's just going to add ```1``` to whatever ```i``` is.

Each time this loops/iterates, ```i``` is going to increase by ```1``` all the way up until it hits ```i < 10``` is no longer true.
*/

// for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
//   console.log(i)
// }

/*
If changed to ```i >= 10```
*/

// for(let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
//   console.log(i)
// }

/*
How to skip an iteration or to do something else during a specific iteration.
Let's say that for number ```5```  we want it to say something differently.
*/

// for(let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
//   if (i === 5) {
//     console.log('5 is my favorite number');
//   }
//   console.log('Number ' + i)
// }

/*
Notice that is still does ```Number 2``` in the logs. Use ```continue``` statement to exclude ```Number 2``` by stopping at ```5 is my favorite number```. ```continue``` just means keep going with the loop, go to the next iteration.
*/

// for(let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
//   if (i === 5) {
//     console.log('5 is my favorite number');
//     continue;
//   }
//   console.log('Number ' + i)
// }

/*
How to break out of the loop.
*/

// for(let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
//   if (i === 5) {
//     console.log('5 is my favorite number');
//     continue;
//   }

//   if (i === 7) {
//     console.log('Stop the loop')
//     break;
//   }

//   console.log('Number ' + i)
// }

// While Loop

/*
How we set up the while-loop, we set the varible outside of the loop. Then ```while``` with our condition inside ```()```, like ```i``` is less than ```10```. Then, inside the ```{}``` tell it to do whatever you want to do, and then increment with ``i++```. Make sure you do the increment inside the while-loop.
*/

// let i = 0;

// while(i < 10) {
//   console.log('Number ' + i);
//   i++;
// }

/*
This works in the same situation like in the for-loop we did earlier.
*/

// Do While Loop
/*
The do-while-loop is different bc it's always gonna run at least once no matter what. Use ```do {}``` have it do something and increment with ```i++```. Under the ```do{}```, make a ```while(){}``` it's going to have the condition, like ```(i < 10)```
*/

// let i = 0;                // Change it to 100, it'll still run

// do {
//   console.log('Number ' + i);
//   i++;
// }

// while(i < 10);

/*
You'll get the same output as the while-loop done earlier. But, the difference is that ```console.log('Number ' + i);``` is always going to run no matter what, even if the while condition isn't met.
*/

// Array Specific Iterations
/*
Let's start off with creating a variable called ```cars``` with values of car names. So we have these car names and now we can for a for-loop, ```let i = 0;``` and the condition is going to be, ```i``` is less than the array name, which is ```cars``` dot ```length```, so we can count the number of values inside the cars array, and then do ```i++```. In this case, ```cars.length``` is going to equal ```4``` bc there are four values inside the array. If we do ```console.log(i)``` its going to just output the index numbers of where there are values. Instead, let's log out the cars names by using ```console.log(cars[i])``` that's how you access the values in the array. Using ```(cars[i])```, the first iteration will be car [0] which is Nissan, next Honda, next etc.
*/

// const cars = ['Nissan', 'Honda', 'Lexus', 'Toyota'];

// for (let i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
//   console.log(cars[i]);
// }

// While loop version

// const cars = ['Nissan', 'Honda', 'Lexus', 'Toyota'];

// let i = 0;
// while(i < cars.length) {
//   console.log(cars[i]);
//   i++;
// }

// forEach() Array Loops version
/*
Take the array name ```cars``` and dot ```forEach()```. This ```forEach()``` method takes in a callback function, an anonymous function ```function(){}```. Inside the anonymous function parentheses, it can take in three different parameters, whatever you want to use as the current iteration/iterator, but for this example, we only need one. Let's just use ```car``` as the parameter, it makes since we're dealing with cars - its the single unit of the array name. You'll see that we get the same log output as the for-loop and while-loop, but it's a lot cleaner looking code.

So, if looping through an array, it's best to use a ```forEach()``` method.
*/

// const cars = ['Nissan', 'Honda', 'Lexus', 'Toyota'];

// cars.forEach(function(car) {
//   console.log(car);
// });

// map() Method
/*
The ```map()``` method can work in a few difference ways actually. But, it's basically to return something different, like to return a different array.

In this example, let's create an array of object of ```users```. Next, set another variable called ```ids```, and let's take this users array of objects and create another array of ids for these users. To do this, set ```users``` dot ```map()```. The ```map()``` takes in a function, just like the ```forEach()``` method. Inside the callback function parenthese, use ```user``` and then ```return user.id;```. So, it's going to loop through and it's going to return each ```id``` in the ```users``` array.
*/

// const users = [
//   {id: 1, name: 'Jim'},
//   {id: 2, name: 'Nancy'},
//   {id: 3, name: 'Kale'},
//   {id: 4, name: 'Peter'},
//   {id: 5, name: 'Cole'}
// ];

// const ids = users.map(function(user) {
//   return user.id;
// });

// console.log(ids);             // Logs [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

/*
There's a lot more to ```forEach()``` and map()``` these are just the basics.
*/

// Another example of ```forEach()```
/*
Again, in ```forEach()``` there's three parameters that it can take in.
* One is the ```current``` iterator - the parameter can be anything, usually its the single unit of the array's plural name.
* Second is the ```index```
* Third is the actual ```array``` - it's going to loop through the entire array each time.

You'll notice that it starts at ```0``` and its increments by 1 at a time.
*/

// const cars = ['Nissan', 'Honda', 'Lexus', 'Toyota'];

// cars.forEach(function(car, index, array) {
//   // console.log(`${index} : ${car}`);
//   console.log(array)
// });

// ```for in``` Loop
/*
It's often used for Objects. 

In this example, lets create a single object called ```user``` and we'll this user object a ```firstName```, ```lastName``` and ``age```. Then we're gonna start off like a regular for-loop with ```for(let x in user)``` this is called a ```for in loop```. First, let's ```console.log(x)```, which will only log out the keys for us. Now, if we want to get the object, lets try using a template string ```(`${x} : ${user[x]}`)```
*/

const user = {
  firstName: 'Charlie',
  lastName: 'McVille',
  age: 29
}

for (let x in user) {
  // console.log(x);         // Logs the keys in obj: firstName, lastName, age
  console.log(`${x} : ${user[x]}`); // Logs keys and value
}
